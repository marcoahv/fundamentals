Now, I keep telling you that we are defining callback functions, but callback functions are functions that are passed in as arguments to other functions, right? Well, where are those other functions? This is the point where the promise we have created comes into picture.

Of course, in a practical scenario, your result would be an object or an array or any data type that your async operation returns, and the error might be an object with different error codes.

In the below two-argument approach, the on rejection callback handles errors from only the promise. However, if your callback function itself throws an error or an exception, there is no code to handle that. If you have a catch function, though, even if your on fulfillment callback throws an exception, it is still caught, and then you can handle that exception gracefully.
